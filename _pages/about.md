Hello! My name is Arnadi Murtiyoso (or Ari, for short). I received my Bachelor's degree in Geodetic and Geomatics Engineering at the <a href="https://itb.ac.id/" target="_blank">Bandung Institute of Technology</a> (Indonesia) in 2011. What started as a bachelor's thesis in 3D photogrammetric reconstruction for Javanese temples brought me to Strasbourg, France, where I completed a Master's programme (_Diplôme d'ingénieur_) in topography and surveying at <a href="http://www.insa-strasbourg.fr/" target="_blank">INSA Strasbourg</a> in 2016. 

I then continued my work in a PhD focusing on the use and exploitation of 3D technologies (photogrammetry, laser scanning, etc.) and point clouds for cultural heritage documentation. I defended my thesis in 2020 and was awarded a PhD by the <a href="https://www.unistra.fr/" target="_blank">University of Strasbourg</a>. During my PhD thesis, I worked with various cultural heritage sites in France, Indonesia and Italy. 

I am currently employed since January 2022 as a postdoc researcher at the <a href="https://form.ethz.ch/" target="_blank">Forest Resources Management</a> group at ETH Zurich, Switzerland, where I investigate the use of 3D technologies to support a virtual forest system.

I am always open for collaborations and discussions! If you have anything to talk on the topic of photogrammetry, geomatics, point clouds or 3D heritage documentation, don't hesitate to [email me](mailto:arnadi.murtiyoso@usys.ethz.ch) or contact/connect with me via any of the social media handles that you can find on the left sidebar!
