Hello! My name is Arnadi Murtiyoso (or Ari, for short). I received my Bachelor's degree in Geodetic and Geomatics Engineering at the [Bandung Institute of Technology (Indonesia)](https://itb.ac.id/) in 2011. What started as a bachelor's thesis in 3D photogrammetric reconstruction for Javanese temples brought me to Strasbourg, France, where I completed a Master's programme (_Diplôme d'ingénieur_) in topography and surveying at [INSA Strasbourg](http://www.insa-strasbourg.fr/) in 2016. This time around working with drones, I mapped the historic St-Pierre-le-Jeune church in Strasbourg. I then continued my work in a PhD focusing on the use and exploitation of 3D technologies (photogrammetry, laser scanning, etc.) and point clouds for cultural heritage documentation. I defended my thesis in 2020 and was awarded a PhD by the [University of Strasbourg](https://www.unistra.fr/). During my PhD thesis, I worked with various cultural heritage sites in France, Indonesia and Italy. My work also brought me in contact with machine and deep learning techniques for point cloud processing.

I am currently employed since January 2022 as a postdoc researcher at the [Forest Resources Management](https://form.ethz.ch/) group at ETH Zurich, Switzerland, where I investigate the use of 3D technologies to support a virtual forest system.

Feel free to take a look at my publications, my 3D model portofolio (on Sketchfab) or my CV. Do not hesitate to contact me via any of the social handles that you can find on the left sidebar!
